## Motivation

Victoria, Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions in the world - given its fire-conducive weather and fuel conditions.

## Research Questions

-   What part of Victoria has higher bush fire risk?
-   What factors are the more important for predicting the risk accurately
-   How change in factors affect the bush fire risk of a particular location?

## Methodology

### What part of Victoria has higher bush fire risk?

-   Kernal density estimation

    A [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics "Non-parametric statistics") method to [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation "Estimation") the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function "Probability density function") of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") based on [*kernels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics) "Kernel (statistics)") as [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function "Weight function").

```{r}
# Data
set.seed(14012021)
data <- rnorm(200, mean = 4)

# Kernel density estimation
d <- density(data)

# Kernel density plot
plot(d, lwd = 2, main = "Default kernel density plot")
```

## Methodology

### What part of Victoria has higher bush fire risk?

-   Bias of density estimation of edges (or frontiers) of regions

    -   Broader bias

    -   Ripley's correction

```{r}
#child = "sample_density_estimation.Rmd"
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-cap: "Desity estimation with correction of broader bias"


  #  print(p_igni)
```
