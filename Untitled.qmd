## Motivation

Victoria, Australia is one of the most fire-prone regions in the world - given its fire-conducive weather and fuel conditions.

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Understand risk of fire in different area of Victoria

-   Provide guidance to allocating resource to areas with higher fire risk

-   Develop strategies to mitigate fire risk

## Research Questions

What part of Victoria has higher bush fire risk?

-   To allocate resources wisely

What factors are the more important for predicting the risk accurately?

-   To understand how different factor associate with fire risk

How change in factors affect bush fire risk of a particular location?

-   Provide on guidance on mitigating fire risk under a particular condition

## Methodology

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
**2 Dimensional Kernel density estimation**
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](data/matheq.png){fig-align="left" width="259"}
:::

::: {.column width="100%"}
**n** is the number of items in each vector x and y, in our case the longitude and latitude

**x** = (*x*~1~, *x*~2~, ..., *x~d~*)^*T*^, x~*i*~= (*x~i~*~1~, *x~i~*~2~, ..., *x~id~*)^*T*^, *i* = 1, 2 are vectors representing x and y values

**H** is the bandwidth (or smoothing): *2Ã—2* matrix which is [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_matrix "Symmetric matrix") and [positive definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_definite_matrix "Positive definite matrix")

***K*** is the [kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics) "Kernel (statistics)") function which is a symmetric multivariate density

## Methodology 

A [non-parametric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-parametric_statistics "Non-parametric statistics") method to [estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation "Estimation") the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function "Probability density function") of a [random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable") based on [*kernels*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics) "Kernel (statistics)") as [weights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_function "Weight function").

**Example of 2D density estimation:**

-   Here is a set of randomly generated points

```{r}
set.seed(123)
x = runif(100)
y = runif(100)
plot(x,y)

```

## **Example of 2D density estimation:** 

x:0.48, y: 0.44

```{r}
library(MASS)
kde <- kde2d(x,y,n=100)
# Library
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(z = kde$z, type = "surface")
p 
```

## Comparison of Bandwidth Selection:

::: {.column width="50%"}
Bandwidth: (1,1)

:::

Bandwidth(0.02606,0.02606) , which is around 2.90 kilometers in radius.
:::

## Result of 2D Density Estimation (2)

Increase the bandwidth to 8.7 kilometers in radius.

## Result of 2D Density Estimation (3)

Decrease the bandwidth to 1.45 kilometers in radius.

## Methodology

### What part of Victoria has higher bush fire risk?

-   Bias of density estimation of edges (or frontiers) of regions

    -   Broader bias

    -   Ripley's correction

```{r}
#child = "sample_density_estimation.Rmd"
    #| echo: false
    #| fig-cap: "Desity estimation with correction of broader bias"


  #  print(p_igni)
```
